Joseph McDonald - Homework 1


In int_ring, I structured the program so that the argument giveen to the
executable is the number of loops around the process ring. So if there are 10
processes and N = 1000, then 10,000 messages will be passed. Latency is
measured as the time for each Send/Receive pair, or time/N*P, where P is the
number of processes.

I tested int_ring on a single CIMS box first using 4 processes, which
consistently gave a latency on the order of 1 microsecond. I then tried 8
processes which regularly gave microsecond latencies but would occasionally
require times around 1 millisecond. Running with 10 processes consistently had
latencies on the order of 1 millisecond. For this reason I suspect my box has
8 cores. Requiring 20 processes consistently took my box around 5 milliseconds
to send and receive a message.

I then tested int_ring on crunchy1 for 20 processes and got latencies that
would regularly vary between several microseconds to a few hundred
microseconds, still noticeably faster than the performance on my personal box.
Splitting the 20 processes between crunchy1 and crunchy 3 consistently
required around 150 microseconds.
